## IoC with Typescript Decorators

As for the NestJS requisite, feel free to opt for simply Node + Express. I think the one thing we’d like to see included in the approach you take is some strategy for handling dependencies (preferably with dependency injection). You can pick up any one of various libraries out there to achieve this — or create your own if you’re feeling brave. Extra points for making use of TS decorators ;-)
